# Flappy Bird LLM Implementations

This repository contains different implementations of the classic Flappy Bird game, each generated by a different Large Language Model (LLM). It serves as an interesting comparison of how different AI models approach game development.

## Overview

Each implementation is a unique take on Flappy Bird, showcasing different coding styles and approaches while maintaining the core gameplay mechanics. The implementations were generated by:

- O3 mini
- Claude 3.5
- Gemini 2.0 (Flash and Flash Thinking)
- DeepSeek-R1
- Mistral le Chat

Gemini 2.0 Flash created a non-functional version of the game.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sroopra/flappy-bird-llm.git
cd flappy-bird-llm
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix/macOS
```

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```


3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## To run a specific implementation:

```bash
python flappy_bird_o3mini.py
```

## Game Controls
Press *SPACE* key to make the bird flap
